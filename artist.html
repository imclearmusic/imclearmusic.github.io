        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Discover the man behind the name</i></p>
        <h2 class="w3-left ">About him</h2></br>
        <p class="w3-justify w3-padding-32">iMCleAr_ is the name of a French musician who started his musical adventure in June 2024. 
          Well in fact, his passion for music existed years before he started composing and producing songs.
          He remembers listening to his parent's CD's in the car, not understanding a word of the lyrics, but still enjoying the experience.   
          Music have always been the most important thing in his life, and being able to create songs was a huge achievement, 
          something he always dreamed of! Since the moment he got his hands on his beloved Minilab 3, the keyboard that started it all, 
          iMCleAr_ never stopped creating, exploring hundreds of different musical genres, as a tribute to the diversity of music.
          iMCleAr_ has only gotten better, both in terms of equipment and experience, which allows him to produce something new with each composition released, 
          and which makes him a special artist, without a predefined genre, but with a very particular musical touch.</br>
          So if you wanna discover his universe, go stream his songs on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/artist/0EYsCeBgFfoiWQ8u8O7a3S?si=kISBgA_8SnqLS1lIl8ogfw" class="w3-text-green">Spotify</a>!</p>
        <h2 class="w3-left ">His gear</h2></br>
        <p class="w3-justify w3-padding-32">The first gear iMCleAr_ ever received was a black <a href="https://www.arturia.com/fr/products/hybrid-synths/minilab-3/overview">Minilab 3 from Arturia</a>, 
          a MIDI keyboard, which he uses in every composition and allows him to interact with his DAW and his VST's patches. It was a great way to discover every preset and every song that could be played. 
          As a huge analog synthesizer fan, he recently acquired a Behringer <a href="https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0722-ABF">PROvsMINI</a>, which he can connect to his audio interface, a <a href="https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0805-AAJ">Behringer U-Phoria UMC22</a>, 
          to record his own sounds and create his own patches. One of his biggest dreams is to possess his favorite synth: the monstrous and powerful <a href="https://www.arturia.com/fr/products/hardware-synths/polybrute/overview">Arturia PolyBrute</a>, 
          but it's still a dream for now. To mix and master his tracks, iMCleAr_ uses an <a href="https://www.akaipro.com/midimix">Akai Midimix</a>, a compact mixing table. Sitting in his room is a wonderful <a href="https://fr.yamaha.com/fr/products/musical_instruments/keyboards/arranger_workstations/psr-sx600/index.html">Yamaha PSR-SX600</a>, 
          an insane keyboard with thousands of presets, which he uses to jam a bit and get new ideas. This is a great tool that can create fully finished songs by itself, 
          but all its capabilities have not yet been exploited! However, only one software rules them all: <a href="https://www.ableton.com/fr/shop/live/">Ableton Live Lite 12</a>, the most basic version of Ableton, 
          with which he gets the most out of. Real instruments are great, but plugins and VSTs are also required to create the best songs.That's why iMCleAr_ uses various other 
          softwares such as <a href="https://vital.audio">Vital</a>, <a href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io">Surge XT</a>, <a href="https://www.tracktion.com/products/zyklop">Zyklop</a>, 
          <a href="https://u-he.com/products/tyrelln6/">TyrellN6</a>, <a href="https://www.airmusictech.com/virtual-instruments/db-33/">DB-33</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.airmusictech.com/virtual-instruments/vacuum/">Vacuum</a>, <a href="https://www.airmusictech.com/virtual-instruments/xpand-2/">Xpand!2</a>, and 
          <a href="https://www.arturia.com/fr/products/software-instruments/analoglab/overview?utm_source=google&utm_source_platform=Google+Ads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Lab_SRC_Software_Bucket_Core&utm_id=20666400222&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqIm_BhDnARIsAKBYcmuuuzqqOHJsahNlX3-RDWbeOyyjy7bsglf3cLxp_aoBuSfDedkRGWcaAjteEALw_wcB">Arturia Analog Lab</a>. 
          All of this combined allows him to use thousands.and thousands of sounds, which makes the possibilities almost endless. With all this equipment, one thing is certain: the best is yet to come!</p>
        <h2 class="w3-left ">His ambitions</h2></br>
        <p class="w3-justify w3-padding-32">Through his music, iMCleAr_ tries to bring together as many people as possible and connect them to his music. 
          His goal is not to have a fanbase, but rather to create a community of enthusiasts who want to express themselves and come together. 
          Music is an art, a collaborative passion, and it is thanks to others that we can progress and become a better musician. iMCleAr_ is not looking for fame or money, 
          his primary goal was simply to share his creations. However, like any artist, he wants to become "famous", in the sense that his music influences and impacts as many people 
          as possible. So if you want to be part of the adventure, check out the links to <a href="index.html">my socials!</a> Dream big!</p>
